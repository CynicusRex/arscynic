  <description>My musings on nothing and everything, frequently influenced by Cynicism, which I interpret as the pursuit of modernity in proportion to nature.</description>

    <title>Running away from love.</title>
    <description>Tragic is facing love and not recognizing it, unconsciously suppressing reciprocity. “All You Need Is Love”, The Beatles sang. Not quite. When the reproductive organs do the “thinking” all one needs is lovers. Like alcohol or money, it is prone to addiction, beyond distracting, destructive, and eventually leads to sadness.</description>

    <title>To consider antireligion instead of atheism.</title>
    <description>The harm of religion is historically evident whereas the presence or absence of gods is not. Ultimately, the continued existence of religion is predicated on the indoctrination of children and suppression of rational thought. Therefore I am against religion but not necessarily against the idea of gods. For all we know gods are computer scientists and we are in their video game.</description>

    <title>“Is it okay to live with my parents at age n?”</title>
    <description>If you're regularly asking “should I move out?”, chances are your life will improve significantly after doing so. I've convinced myself for years that it wasn't worth it, but living alone has been nothing but nourishing.</description>

    <title>Einstein's theory of antiwork.</title>
    <description>From antiwork in the USA to “tang ping” (躺平) or “lying flat” in China, people are fed up with the grind. Could it be that we shouldn't live to work, but work to live? That we shouldn't serve the economy, but the economy should serve us?</description>

    <title>Web4 should run on LaTeX.</title>
    <description>The World Wide Web is broken: it is dominated by a handful of websites, nearly everything is financed by ads, bloated tech needlessly slows down surfing, NFTs and blockchain are digital cancer, et cetera. Stop it. Just stop it.</description>

    <title>The folly of pride.</title>
    <description>Winning necessarily comes down to luck or the defeat of an inferior. Both are nothing to be proud of. Therefore, we should not compete for the sake of being better than others, but only to improve ourselves and help others do the same.</description>

    <title>I wish I never bought bitcoin.</title>
    <description>Bitcoin incentivizes greed. It robbed me from my childlike curiosity and fascination for science. Bitcoin is the biggest inadvertent pyramid scheme ever and blockchain is snake oil. Take your spam elsewhere.</description>

    <title>Work less, play more!</title>
    <description>People should do less buying, working, littering, and more reading, exercising, enjoying nature. We all demand change, but we aren't prepared to change ourselves. An article originally written for the magazine Zoeklicht. I omitted one paragraph about bitcoin because I now strongly oppose crypto“currencies”.</description>
