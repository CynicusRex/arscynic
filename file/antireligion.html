    <h1>To consider antireligion instead of atheism.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">The harm of religion is historically evident whereas the presence or absence of gods is not. Ultimately, the continued existence of religion is predicated on the indoctrination of children and suppression of rational thought. Therefore I am against religion but not necessarily against the idea of gods. For all we know gods are computer scientists and we are in their video game.</p>

    <hr class="hr-long">

    <h2>Is antireligion racist?</h2>
    <p>No. Religion is not a race, but a race to the bottom. It's a group of people—fallible like any of us—who decide upon a set of ideas that cannot be questioned: dogma. It follows that antireligion is “dogmist” and not racist. Also, there's only the human race. Any further hierarchy among humans is false and folly.</p>

    <h2>Is antireligion Islamophobic?</h2>
    <p>Yes, but the word Islamophobic is a dysphemism because it makes the term sound worse than it is. Likewise for Christophobia. I think these words are being exploited and have an inaccurate definition. There's nothing wrong with being scared of dangerous ideas. Pacifists aren't slandered as “warphobists” either.</p>

    <p>People use “Islamophobia” because they feel personally attacked when their ideas get scrutinized. When one's whole world revolves around religion it becomes difficult to separate one's ideas from one's identity, so they take it personally. This isn't isolated to religion, it applies to the populace in general as well. Instead of self-reflection—questioning the validity one's thoughts—it's easier to silence opposition with slander. Dirty, but unfortunately it still works.</p>

    <h2>Atheism misses the point.</h2>
    <p>Atheism: “the doctrine or belief that there is no God.” Considering what I've mentioned above, notice the resurfacing problem? Doctrine, dogma. Even though there's as much evidence for <em>Zeus</em> as there is for <em>the Flying Spaghetti Monster</em>, why bother. We can't spy on people's thoughts anyway, yet. As long as people don't <em>act</em> on irrational convictions there is little harm in believing that “supreme” beings exist. If these gods <em>do</em> exist then they're probably computer scientists who built an advanced <em>Age of Empires</em> game. Occam's razor: the simplest explanation is usually the right one. So, which sounds more likely? Omnipotent gods creating an unfathomably complex being made from DNA, only to make masturbation a sin and watch the consequences? Or a CEO deciding that natural disasters must remain an ingame feature because cost-benefit analysis projects less profits if the game is less challenging, less “fun”. Given that we're still afflicted with rampant human greed, I can confidently guess which one is more likely. But in the end, evolution without simulation theory is still simpler than evolution within simulation theory. I digress.</p>

    <p>Atheism too sparingly addresses the actual crux of its importance: it's not the <em>individual</em> belief in gods that harms—though gullibility is a catalyst—instead it's the <em>collective</em> religious actions that causes most damage. As with many bad things in society, these actions are characterized by “smart” people taking advantage of the gullible, hence why religion starts at birth. There's nothing easier than to mold the mind of a defenseless impressionable child. What begins with a seemingly innocuous form of baptism and communion soon segways into prayer, i.e., scare tactics, which in turn leads to confession, i.e., medieval <em>mass</em> surveillance, resulting in a cult that practices paying for absolution, celibacy leading to widespread sexual molestation <span class="source"></span>, female genital mutilation, witch hunting, castigating homosexuality, foregoing modern medicine for faith healing, capital punishment for apostasy or being an unveiled female… et cetera. These dangerous beliefs and barbaric practices occur to this day.</p>

    <!-- <p class="quote">“Prayer. How to do nothing and still think you're helping.”</p> -->
  
    <p class="quote">“Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.” —Voltaire <span class="quote-year">(1694 – 1778)</span></p>
  
    <!-- <p class="quote">“I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church. All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit. I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.” —Thomas Paine <span class="quote-year">(1737 – 1809)</span> <span class="source"></span></p> -->

    <p>Since religion necessitates the indoctrination of children and suppression of rational thought, I consider it evil. Religion should only be thought in history books. All of it. The good and bad. And if individuals of a ripe age still come to decide they want to be religious, let them. However, these will be few, for it is no match against history and philosophy</a>.</p>

    <p class="quote">“Find a society that's adopted the teachings of Spinoza, Voltaire, Galileo, Einstein, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and gone down the pits—as a result of doing that—into famine and war and dictatorship and torture and repression. That's the experiment I would like to run. I don't think that's going to end up with a gulag.” —Christopher Hitchens <span class="quote-year">(1949 – 2011)</span> <span class="source"></span></p>

    <h2>What should we learn from religion?</h2>

    <p>There is one redeeming factor that prevents me from throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Religious morals and ethics? No. While religion does contain aphorisms, philosophy has more, does it better, and includes <em> logic</em>. Conversely, scripture is vague. While I was delighted to discover <em>riba</em>, “a concept in Islam that refers broadly to the concept of growth, increasing, or exceeding, which in turn forbids interest credited from loans or deposits”, religion always crumbles due to vagueness: “While Muslims agree that riba is prohibited, not all agree on what precisely it is.” <span class="source"></span> I.e., if something is considered haram by scholar A, one can simply find a scholar B who considers it halal.</p>

    <p>Not only is religion vague, it is dishonest. For instance, let's talk homosexuality. While conversing with a Muslim former colleague (A) I learned that even though the religious say they supposedly want tolerance and acceptance for all, do they actually believe it? </p>

    <p class="quote">Q: “Do you have a problem with homosexuality?”<br>
      A: “Look. They can do whatever they want, but it's abnormal you see?”<br>
      Q: “In the strict definition of the word abnormal I agree, i.e., heterosexuality is a lot more prevalent than homosexuality, making the latter rare—“abnormal”. But I don't consider it wrong. Do you? Do you consider it a sin even though it harms no one?”<br>
      Long silence…<br>
      A: “Yes, I consider it a sin.”<br>
      Q: “Okay then.”</p>

    <p>Christopher Hitchens was right, religion does poison everything. Even though “A” said people are free to do whatever they please, following it up with “homosexuality is a sin” arguably exposes his feigned tolerance. Perhaps I'm prejudiced, but I think it's fair to assume which laws he might <em>actually</em> tolerate. “If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.” Look at what happened in Afghanistan when the Taliban took over:</p>

    <p class="quote">“Women have seen their rights obliterated. The Taliban have prohibited most girls from attending secondary school, banned all women from attending and teaching at universities, and prevented women from working. In December 2022, the group prohibited women from working at local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The UN Development Program (UNDP) has estimated that restricting women’s employment could cost up to 5 percent of Afghanistan’s gross domestic product (GDP). Amnesty International has reported a drastic increase in the number of women arrested for violating discriminatory policies, such as rules requiring women to only appear in public with a male chaperone and to completely cover their bodies. The rates of child marriage have also increased.” —Lindsay Maizland, The Taliban in Afghanistan, 2023 <span class="source"></span></p>

    <p>Now look at Iran, Mahsa Amini was beaten to death for wearing tight trousers… justifiably resulting in additional mass protests <span class="source"></span>. If this doesn't infuriate you—before you remember your stoic principles—well then screw you. Okay, sorry, calm down. Let me put it like this. Similar to how Sal Khan's mind gets blown by Euler's Identity, if all of this injustice doesn't make your blood boil, you have no emotions as well <span class="source"></span>. But before we apostatise en masse, I still need to answer the original question.</p>

    <p>The redeeming factor of religion is a sense of community. My opinion is that community, brotherhood, loyalty, oneness, or whatever is synonymous, is sorely lacking in secular societies <!-- “God created mankind in his own image” <span class="source"></span>, whereas mankind created god in himself, the individual.  --> where each is <a href="./play.html">on their own island</a>. Instead of churches we have shopping malls. Instead of temperance we have glut. Instead of altruism we have greed. The former for the benefit of <del>god</del> the church's finances, the latter for the benefit of the <del>economy</del> corporate profits.</p>

    <p>Despite my fondness of science, it does not feel inclusive like religion. I still feel it brings with it a certain air of pretence, superiority. Some people pride themselves on being in a club for only a limited amount of smart people. Sorry mister Prof. Dr. Eng., but you're missing the point. You're not better than anyone, you just won the genetic/environmental lottery. With that in mind it should be obvious to anyone that the point of science is to improve the world so everyone could optimally feel stimulated by cognitively demanding tasks, be it art or science or whatever in between. Sadly, now, academia is still highly competitive, and oftentimes downright cut-throat:</p>

    <p class="quote">“Wiles probably was also worried that someone who read the proposed proof might somehow steal it and send it out under his or her own name. This, unfortunately, does happen in academia.” —Amir D. Aczel, Fermat's Last Theorem <span class="source"></span>.</p>

    <p>Instead:</p>

    <p class="quote">“Study to be accomplished, not affluent.” —3 Idiots <span class="source"></span></p>

    <p>It's stories like the movie <em>3 Idiots</em> that are perfectly suitable to replace religion because they touch upon everything life has to offer: love-hate, comedy-tragedy, life-death, all without the need for dogma. Within that train of thought—next to nurturing curiosity—schools should way more revolve around figuring out what makes life worth living. What it means to lead a good life. How we should treat others. How we can love each other better. Et cetera. Yes, those are things discussed in religious class, but with itself as the answer: being a good Christian, being a good Muslim, dogma. Discard the dogma, just be good.</p>

    <p>Good toward yourself <em>and</em> others. Community is what we should strive for. Doing things for the sake of helping others, in competition with only oneself. Most contemporary mandatory education still revolves around the opposite: molding an obedient working class in a very competitive atmosphere. Art and science for the most part detached. Cold, calculated, but with plenty of distractions/entertainment to keep us from challenging the status quo. But as far as life itself goes, we have to figure it out as we go along, admittedly not in a small part caused by the vacuum where religion used to be. And unlike some trial and error in math classes, some mistakes in real life are difficult to reverse despite being easy to avoid. Imagine an opposite environment where not individual test scores but mastery and cooperation is central <span class="source"></span>. How nourishing that would, especially to those with with stifling parents. I dare to wager that after having gone through such an education system the students would way more easily and organically learn <em>and</em> remember all the knowledge they're now force-fed at contemporary schools. Moreover, because many parents fuck up parenting, which leads many on a virtue-ridden path, it would provide a safe haven, a home for those who don't have one. Something to look forward to, something to live for. My goodness, the amount of human potential that is still to be unlocked is unfathomable.</p>

    <p>Another great movie that showcases the human potential is <em>Captain Fantastic</em>. To describe it boorishly, it mocks the food industry through fat people, contemporary education, and religion. However, it simultaneously questions itself as well, which religion doesn't, or it wouldn't exist.</p>

    <p class="quote">“First off, Leslie practiced Buddhism. Which, to her, was a philosophy and not an organized religion. In fact, Leslie abhorred organized religion, thought it the single most dangerous fairy-tale ever invented, used to strike fear and obedience into the hearts of the innocent and uninformed. She saw it not just as a source of injustice, but as a crime against humanity…” —Captain Fantastic <span class="source"></span></p>

    <h2>Where to go from here?</h2>
    <p>Don't be obnoxious about it, just as how one should approach veganism or anything else that goes against the grain. Antireligion gets enough of a bad reputation as it is, being wrongfully associated with racism, so play your cards right. What does this mean in practice? Don't go introducing the topic when uncalled for. Don't think you're better than others who <em>are</em> religious, so attack the idea, not the person. And, as usual, stay humble. Forever realize that everyone is a product of their nature/environment. Be a factor that multiplies and not one that divides. All it takes is a nudge in the right direction <span class="source"></span>.</p>
