    <h1>Philophobia, the fear of love.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">A cardinal mistake in life is facing genuine love and not recognizing it. Or recognizing it, and unconsciously suppressing reciprocity. Love is all you need, they say. False. When your penis does the “thinking” all you need is lovers. Like heroin, or money, it is prone to addiction and very distracting. All you need is proper education and experience. Love will follow.</p>

    <h2>Prelude.</h2>
    <p>I will come across as a bad person. That's because I was. Sorry. Don't waste your energy hating me, I'm providing my own abundance of mental flagellation.</p>

    <p>When I first set foot in Brussels this year, my great relocation, I told myself not to have a relationship for a year and speedrun through experiences I should've had in my twenties. Being a bachelor, having my own place, alone, you catch my drift. Meanwhile, I was still under the impression that a requirement for a good relationship is immediate infatuation, that certain kind of attraction that lingers throughout the day. Turns out I was wrong. I was under the impression that I was prone to certain physical traits. Turn out I was wrong. All in all regarding relationships, I was under the impression that I was right. I was wrong. A layman would mistake me for a wise man by quoting Socrates: “He knows that he knows nothing.” Socrates, however, would quote his contemporary layman: “What an idiot.”</p>

    <p>Around a month after arrival I met a certain Star Wars fan, but it needed very little force to gravitate towards each other. There was no pretending. The laughter was organic and plenty. She pulled me out of my pampered comfort zone, and I obliged. But given my inexperience, and her steadfastness, things went awry.</p>

    <p>WIP</p>

    <h2>Claustrophobia by caressing.</h2>
    <p>I have a natural talent for running. Fast. Unfortunately it's a condition I cannot seem to contain to bipedal movement. I've run from love twice. Not because there were compatibility problems—on the contrary—but because of feeling uncomfortable, constricted. A sensation of remarkable uneasiness. Like claustrophobia, an intense urge to get out. Even a simple caress of the head could trigger it. I don't know why.</p>

    <p>I don't even know where to go with this essay. To a psychologist would be a wise move probably. Before last year I've never even considered it because I assumed all of the above just means something isn't meant to be. Nonsense in hindsight. The tragedy is that sometimes it <em>is</em> meant to be, and leaving makes life worse for both. The converse being equally possible of course. Anyway, I've had a fair share of encounters with women, and most of the time you both just feel there's no synergy. But once in a while you just meet someone and you can effortlessly keep talking. No friction, no pretending, no holding back, you're in tune with each other.</p>

    <p>But then: Beastie Boys - <em>Sabotage</em>. What follows is some of the possible causes, and the most important realizations I've had this year. Blind of all the baggage one carries, the mind plays tricks on you, which are easily but ignorantly interpreted as a valid instinct/intuition.</p>

    <h2>Polyamory versus monogamy.</h2>
    <p>I've never settled on whether monogamy makes sense or not. On one hand...</p>

    <h2>“It doesn't make sense!”</h2>

    <h2>An affectionate punch.</h2>

    <h2>Proud to talk about her even after the breakup.</h2>

    <h2>What is love?</h2>
