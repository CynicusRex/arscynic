    <h1>Running away from love.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Tragic is facing love and not recognizing it. Or recognizing it, and unconsciously suppressing reciprocity. “All You Need Is Love”, The Beatles sang. Not quite. When the reproductive organs do the “thinking” all one needs is lovers. Like alcohol or money, it is prone to addiction, beyond distracting, destructive, and eventually leads to sadness.</p>

    <h2>Prelude.</h2>
    <p>However this text comes across, don't waste your energy hating me for I'm providing my own abundance of mental flagellation.</p>

    <p>When I first set foot in Brussels last year, my great relocation, I told myself not to have a relationship for twelve months and speedrun through experiences I should've had in my twenties. Being a bachelor, having my own place, alone… you catch my drift. Meanwhile though, I was still under the impression that a requirement for a good relationship is immediate infatuation, that certain kind of attraction that lingers throughout the day. Turns out I was wrong. I was under the impression that I was prone to certain physical traits. Turn out I was wrong. All in all regarding relationships I was under the impression that I was right. I was wrong. A layman would mistake me for a wise man by quoting Socrates: “He knows that he knows nothing.” Socrates, however, would quote his contemporary layman: “What an idiot.”</p>

    <p>Around a month after arrival I met “Chocolate Leia”*, a particular Star Wars fan, but it needed very little force to fall into her gravitational pull. There was no pretending. The laughter was organic and plenty. She guided me out of my comfort zone, and I obliged, for a while. Leia's steadfastness and my inexperience caused significant friction. Certain feeling weren't reciprocal so we stopped talking. Didn't work. We were still orbiting each other. Eventually I was strong-armed into an ultimatum: relationship or indefinite silence. Goodbye twelve-months plan. Being coerced never sat well with me. Ideally I wanted to remain friends and see if something grows organically. I had not yet experienced such a thing before, but considering she continuously wandered my mind, it'd be folly not to try.</p>

    <p>Alas. Despite us feeling like we've been together for years, it did not work out. Our different running pace caused anxiety on either her or my side. Already thinking about buying a house somewhere not even two or three months into a relationship is a pro marathon runner level. Usain Bolt wouldn't be able to keep up either; having the potential does not mean possible if the legs aren't trained for it. To continue the metaphor, I have a talent for running. Fast. Unfortunately it's a condition I cannot seem to contain to bipedal movement. I've run from love about thrice that I can remember.</p>

    <p>What follows is some of the possible causes, and the most important realizations I've had this year. Blind of all the baggage one carries, the mind plays tricks on itself, which are easily but ignorantly interpreted as a valid instinct/intuition. Wow. What a convoluted way of euphemizing forgetfulness, ignorance, stupidity, and plain selfishness. Time to owe up to it through my kind of therapy I can pay for, writing.</p>

    <p class="footnote">– – – – – –</p>
    <p class="footnote">* A pseudonym, naturally.</p>

    <h2>Smothered by affection.</h2>

    <p>Not now, nor in the past didn't things work out because there were major compatibility problems—on the contrary—but in large part because of feeling uncomfortable. It's a hard to describe sensation of feeling uneasy and weird with myself. Claustrophobic is an exaggeration, but it does make me want to escape enough to become distant. Curiously enough, I have absolutely no problem being affectionate and caring when the thought of a relationship doesn't enter the picture. But as soon as I feel someone becomes dependent on me, I skedaddle. A shame really, cowardly. Is it awkward that plants depend on water? Is it awkward that honeybees depend on flower pollen? Who the hell feels uncomfortable for depending on oxygen. Like a chemical bond or any natural process it is beautiful that two beings jive so well to the point they need each other. Together they evolve into a unity that couldn't otherwise exist. “The whole being greater than the sum of the parts.”</p>

    <p>What I should've learned by now is that not all forms of dependence are bad. Everything is connected and thus dependent on something else. The repulsion likely originates from growing up with the wrong kind of dependence as an example; a kind of toxic taking someone for granted attitude causing someone to lose their agency. Something I want to avoid at all costs. It is no get out of jail free card though. The fact remains that I've hurt people by turning cold, which truly makes me despise myself—I goddamn hate that I made her cry. I don't think I'm a bad person in general, but this aspect makes me feel the world would be better off without me. What good is one who cannot love?</p>

    <p>“Visit a psychologist!” you say? Before last year that would've never crossed my mind since I assumed all of the above means something isn't meant to be or not the right time. Nonsense in hindsight. Sometimes it <em>is</em> meant to be and leaving makes life less good for both in the long run. The converse being equally possible of course. Anyway, with those select few people the conversations are effortless. No masks, no holding back, you're in tune with each other. Things make sense. But then Jesus Christ on a stick: Beastie Boys - Sabotage&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>.</p>

    <h2>Not practising philosophy.</h2>
    <p>To master a skill one needs rigorous training. Mastering one's mind likewise. No physical training quickly and obviously presents itself through fat and decreased performance. No mental training is more insidious since we easily justify our thoughts. Without mindfulness we drive on autopilot, the rational mind asleep at the wheel.</p>

    <p class="quote">“Diogenes was acting on a crucial idea in Epicurus, that in order to live wisely it isn't enough just to read a philosophical argument once or twice, we need constant reminders of it, or we'll forget. When we're encouraged to go shopping by bright lights and inviting displays, we're quickly liable to lose sight of our true desires. So we have to counteract the influence of advertising by creating advertisements which say what we really do need, and that's why Diogenes put up his wall [on which the philosophy of Epicurus was inscribed].”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></p>

    <p>Due to the excitement of a new life I unconsciously grew to neglect the philosophies within Marcus Aurelius' Meditations and Robin Hard's book on Diogenes. Philosophies that emphasize not being a slave to primeval emotions because these are reactionary and not in our control. What <em>is</em> in our control is the ability to scrutinize those emotions and acknowledge them as animalistic, simple-minded. Additionally they strengthened my resolve in minimalism. To not desire anything beyond what's necessary and to appreciate every possession to the fullest without being overly attached to it.</p>

    <p class="quote">“Those who are in thrall to their stomach and sexual organs and sleep he called triple-slaves.” —Diogenes</p>

    <p class="quote">“You have reason?—Yes, I do.—Then why not put it to use? For if this performs its function, what more do you desire?” —Marcus Aurelius (121–180)</p>

    <p>Once a <a href="../file/greed.html">slave in pursuit of money</a> until Diogenes' Cynicism threw me a rope—which can be used to pull yourself up, or as he exclaims, hang yourself—I fell right back into a similar kind of unexamined pursuit, chasing infatuation. Throughout the ruckus my pea brain even forgot reading <em>Living With Limerence</em>, a book concerning the pitfalls of limerence/infatuation. Limerence being “the state of being obsessively infatuated with someone, usually accompanied by delusions of or a desire for an intense romantic relationship with that person”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>. For crying out loud, this was my review:</p>

    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53551095-living-with-limerence"
      style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"><img border="0" alt="Living with limerence: A guide for the smitten" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1590653712l/53551095._SX98_.jpg" /></a>

    <p>“After reading the first couple of pages: “Wow… So not everyone feels this way?” After completing the book I'm now
    looking at myself from a bird's-eye view, acknowledging a physical adult with the relational maturity of an adolescent.
    I got some work to do.<br /><br />If I'd read this book in high school, my life would've turned out remarkably
    different. Therefore, <i>Living with limerence</i> is a must-read for those who are suckers for infatuation.”</p>

    <p>Some notable quotes:</p>

    <p class="quote">“[…] We are most vulnerable to limerence when we do not understand ourselves, do not understand our drives, and react unthinkingly to the presence of an LO [limerent object] – led by our emotional impulses and enslaved to subconscious urges.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“[…] If you associate limerence with what love is, you will have a life characterised by a series of short-term infatuations. That’s fine, if that’s what you want, but if you are seeking a long-lasting bond of deep love, you need to accept that limerence will only be part of it during the early stages. And, as we’ve already covered in earlier chapters, it’s quite likely that you will succumb to limerence again if you are careless about managing the risks when you are in a long-term relationship.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“The goal, then, is not to stop being a limerent – I fundamentally don’t think that is possible – the goal is to integrate limerence into your life in a healthy way. To accept it as an aspect of yourself, but to develop the self-awareness and resilience needed to regulate it when it’s unwanted.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“They are not that special. Nobody is. You’ve probably had moments of clarity when you’ve seen this, and had that weird dissociative experience of wondering why you are so gaga about someone who is objectively pretty ordinary.”</p>

    <p>I feel deeply taken aback realizing having made the same mistake. A sobering disappointment. “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span> Or more appropriately, considering my apt choice of favourite philosopher Diogenes, also known as “the Dog”: “As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span> Had I discerned those fickle emotions as meaningless limerence the relationship would've had a way higher success rate. Moron.</p>

    <h2>Initial infatuation as a requirement.</h2>
    <p>It seemed logical and natural to assume that initial infatuation was our body's way of pointing out compatible mates. Hence a requirement for a relationship. Not so. About two months after parting ways with Leia I had a deep conversation with someone I had known and talked to for while, but felt nothing for. Not physically, not mentally. Yet after one or two talks there was an unexpected spark. Long story short, the whole thing turned out to be a dud, but then and there it dawned on me that hanging out with someone until healthy infatuation grows organically <em>is</em> possible. My experiment worked, with the wrong person.</p>

    <p>I was lost and running in circles. Not practising philosophy was one thing, having a warped idea about love was another. Alain de Botton's talk about why romantics are ruining love upended my persistent attachment to infatuation. My foundation for relationships were built on quicksand. Case in point, lo and behold the outstanding prescience of the aforementioned book: “a life characterised by a series of short-term infatuations”. A punch in the gut right there.</p>

    <h2>Monogamy versus non-monogamy.</h2>
    <p>Being on the fence about non-monogamy has influenced my capacity for commitment, for better or worse. And I am not the only one, for non-traditional relationship are on the rise in Belgium&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>. Good. Or not? My views in favour and against:</p>

    <p>+ The utilitarian argument. The love of many increases the total amount of happiness in the world. Excluding debauchery, how does loving multiple people deteriorate society?</p>

    <p class="quote">“Love of one is a piece of barbarism: for it is practised at the expense of all others. Love of God likewise.” —Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil</p>

    <p>Jealousy? Sure, but I think that's because we're scared of losing someone, a remnant of a monogamous environment where others are competitors in a zero-sum game&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>: for someone to win, another must lose. Whereas within polyamory others are allies, a non-zero-sum game: for someone to win, another needn't lose.</p>

    <p>+ The imperfection argument. Finding partner Ω (omega) with characteristics {a, b, c, d, e} is unlikely. Why not partner up with person X for reasons {a, b, c} and person Y for reasons {c, d, e}? E.g., imagine loving someone but their antipathy for math leaves a void. You meet another algebra aficionado and fall for each other. Instead of subtracting, just add. Two partners. Feels weird right? But why should it. A nuclear family is no law of nature. I do admit it is easier said than done. It ignores all the difficulties such as dividing attention and multiplying and raising the products.</p>

    <p class="quote">“People were created to be loved. Things were created to be used. The reason why the world is in chaos is because things are being loved and people are being used.” —Unknown&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></p>

    <!-- <p>+ People are not possessions. “She is <em>my</em> wife.” “He is <em>my</em> husband.” The “my” irks me.</p> -->

    <!-- <p>However, it's a weak subjective argument that stems from my aforementioned spurious interpretation of dependence. In a good relationship partners don't consider each other as property of course.</p> -->
    
    <p>- The consumerist argument: when one partner isn't enough, how many are? What prevents us from wanting more and more. “A time constraint.” True, but then what prevents us from acting the same as in serial-monogamy, swapping one partner with another when we find someone “better”. Does non-monogamy teach us that “better” is not, but merely newer? Why would an untrained mind's incapacity to deal with novel shiny things act differently under non-monogamy versus monogamy? Perhaps we should emphasize being happy with what we've got.</p>

    <p>≈ A middle ground might be to not actively seek for multiple partners, but when haphazardly bumping into a second “soul-mate” I think it'd be a shame to destroy instead of nurture. As long as there's clear communication about the feasibility of expectations. Moreover, realistically, considering how extremely rare it is to encounter someone you connect with so profoundly, choice paralysis shouldn't be a problem. “Shouldn't”, because what do I know, I don't even have children yet. I'm probably way too vanilla to pull it off anyway.</p>
