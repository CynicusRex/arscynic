    <h1>Running away from love.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Tragic is facing love and not recognizing it. Or recognizing it, and unconsciously suppressing reciprocity. “All You Need Is Love”, The Beatles sang. Not quite. When the reproductive organs do the “thinking” all one needs is lovers. Like alcohol or money, it is prone to addiction, beyond distracting, destructive, and eventually leads to sadness.</p>

    <h2>Prelude.</h2>
    <p>However this text comes across, don't waste your energy hating me for I'm providing my own abundance of mental flagellation.</p>

    <p>When I first set foot in Brussels last year, my great relocation, I told myself not to have a relationship for twelve months and speedrun through experiences I should've had in my twenties. Being a bachelor, having my own place, alone… you catch my drift. Meanwhile though, I was still under the impression that a requirement for a good relationship is immediate infatuation, that certain kind of attraction that lingers throughout the day. Turns out I was wrong. I was under the impression that I was prone to certain physical traits. Turn out I was wrong. All in all regarding relationships I was under the impression that I was right. I was wrong. A layman would mistake me for a wise man by quoting Socrates: “He knows that he knows nothing.” Socrates, however, would quote his contemporary layman: “What an idiot.”</p>

    <p>Around a month after arrival I met “Chocolate Leia”*, a particular Star Wars fan, but it needed very little force to fall into her gravitational pull. There was no pretending. The laughter was organic and plenty. She guided me out of my comfort zone, and I obliged, for a while. Leia's steadfastness and my inexperience caused significant friction. Certain feeling weren't reciprocal so we stopped talking. Didn't work. We were still orbiting each other. Eventually I was strong-armed into an ultimatum: relationship or indefinite silence. Goodbye twelve-months plan. Being coerced never sat well with me. Ideally I wanted to remain friends and see if something grows organically. I had not yet experienced such a thing before, but considering she continuously wandered my mind, it'd be folly not to try.</p>

    <p>Alas. Despite us feeling like we've been together for years, it did not work out. Our different running pace caused anxiety on either her or my side. Already thinking about buying a house somewhere not even two or three months into a relationship is a pro marathon runner level. Usain Bolt wouldn't be able to keep up either; having the potential does not mean possible if the legs aren't trained for it. To continue the metaphor, I have a talent for running. Fast. Unfortunately it's a condition I cannot seem to contain to bipedal movement. I've run from love about thrice that I can remember.</p>

    <p>What follows is some of the possible causes, and the most important realizations I've had this year. Blind of all the baggage one carries, the mind plays tricks on itself, which are easily but ignorantly interpreted as a valid instinct/intuition. Wow. What a convoluted way of euphemizing forgetfulness, ignorance, stupidity, and plain selfishness. Time to owe up to it through my kind of therapy, writing.</p>

    <p class="footnote">– – – – – –</p>
    <p class="footnote">* A pseudonym, naturally.</p>

    <h2>Smothered by affection.</h2>

    <p>Not now, nor in the past didn't things work out because there were major compatibility problems—on the contrary—but in large part because of feeling uncomfortable. It's a hard to describe sensation of feeling uneasy and weird with myself. Claustrophobic is an exaggeration, but it does make me want to escape enough to become distant. Curiously enough, I have absolutely no problem being affectionate and caring when the thought of a relationship doesn't enter the picture. But as soon as I feel someone becomes dependent on me, I skedaddle. A shame really, cowardly. Is it awkward that plants depend on water? Is it awkward that honeybees depend on flower pollen? Who the hell feels uncomfortable for depending on oxygen? Like a chemical bond or any natural process it is beautiful that two beings jive so well to the point they need each other. Together they evolve into a unity that couldn't otherwise exist. “The whole being greater than the sum of the parts.”</p>

    <p>What I should've learned by now is that not all forms of dependence are bad. Everything is connected and thus dependent on something else. The repulsion likely originates from growing up with the wrong kind of dependence as an example; a kind of toxic taking someone for granted attitude causing that same someone to lose their agency. Something I want to avoid at all costs. It is no get out of jail free card though. The fact remains that I've hurt people by turning cold, which truly makes me despise myself—I goddamn hate that I made Leia cry. I don't think I'm a bad person in general, but this aspect sometimes makes me feel the world would be better off without me. What good is one who cannot love?</p>

    <p>“Visit a psychologist!” you say? Before last year that would've never crossed my mind since I assumed all of the above means something isn't meant to be or it isn't the right time. Nonsense in hindsight. Sometimes it <em>is</em> meant to be and leaving makes life less good for both in the long run. The converse being equally possible of course. Anyway, with those select few people the conversations are effortless. No masks, no holding back, you're in tune with each other. Things make sense. But then Jesus Christ on a stick: Beastie Boys - Sabotage&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>.</p>

    <h2>Not practising philosophy.</h2>
    <p>Mastering a skill requires rigorous training. Mastering one's mind likewise. Lacking physical training quickly and obviously presents itself through fat and decreased performance. Lacking mental training is more insidious since we easily justify our thoughts, or not think at all. Without mindfulness we drive on autopilot, the rational mind asleep at the wheel.</p>

    <p class="quote">“Diogenes was acting on a crucial idea in Epicurus, that in order to live wisely it isn't enough just to read a philosophical argument once or twice, we need constant reminders of it, or we'll forget. When we're encouraged to go shopping by bright lights and inviting displays, we're quickly liable to lose sight of our true desires. So we have to counteract the influence of advertising by creating advertisements which say what we really do need, and that's why Diogenes put up his wall [on which the philosophy of Epicurus was inscribed].”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></p>

    <p>Due to the excitement of a new life I unconsciously grew to neglect the philosophies within Marcus Aurelius' Meditations and Robin Hard's book on Diogenes. Philosophies that emphasize not being a slave to primeval emotions because these are reactionary and not in our control. What <em>is</em> in our control is the ability to scrutinize those emotions and acknowledge them as animalistic, simple-minded. These principles strengthened my resolve in minimalism. To not desire anything beyond what's necessary and to appreciate every possession to the fullest without being overly attached to it.</p>

    <p class="quote">“Those who are in thrall to their stomach and sexual organs and sleep he called triple-slaves.” —Diogenes</p>

    <p class="quote">“You have reason?—Yes, I do.—Then why not put it to use? For if this performs its function, what more do you desire?” —Marcus Aurelius (121–180)</p>

    <p>Once a <a href="../file/greed.html">slave in pursuit of money</a> until Diogenes' Cynicism threw me a rope—which can be used to pull yourself up, or as he exclaims, hang yourself—I fell right back into a similar kind of unexamined pursuit, chasing infatuation. Throughout the ruckus my pea brain even forgot reading <em>Living With Limerence</em>, a book concerning the pitfalls of limerence/infatuation. Limerence being “the state of being obsessively infatuated with someone, usually accompanied by delusions of or a desire for an intense romantic relationship with that person”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>. For crying out loud, this was my review:</p>

    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53551095-living-with-limerence"
      style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"><img border="0" alt="Living with limerence: A guide for the smitten" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1590653712l/53551095._SX98_.jpg" /></a>

    <p>“After reading the first couple of pages: “Wow… So not everyone feels this way?” After completing the book I'm now
    looking at myself from a bird's-eye view, acknowledging a physical adult with the relational maturity of an adolescent.
    I got some work to do.<br /><br />If I'd read this book in high school, my life would've turned out remarkably
    different. Therefore, <i>Living with limerence</i> is a must-read for those who are suckers for infatuation.”</p>

    <p>Some notable quotes:</p>

    <p class="quote">“[…] We are most vulnerable to limerence when we do not understand ourselves, do not understand our drives, and react unthinkingly to the presence of an LO [limerent object] – led by our emotional impulses and enslaved to subconscious urges.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“[…] If you associate limerence with what love is, you will have a life characterised by a series of short-term infatuations. That’s fine, if that’s what you want, but if you are seeking a long-lasting bond of deep love, you need to accept that limerence will only be part of it during the early stages. And, as we’ve already covered in earlier chapters, it’s quite likely that you will succumb to limerence again if you are careless about managing the risks when you are in a long-term relationship.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“The goal, then, is not to stop being a limerent – I fundamentally don’t think that is possible – the goal is to integrate limerence into your life in a healthy way. To accept it as an aspect of yourself, but to develop the self-awareness and resilience needed to regulate it when it’s unwanted.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“They are not that special. Nobody is. You’ve probably had moments of clarity when you’ve seen this, and had that weird dissociative experience of wondering why you are so gaga about someone who is objectively pretty ordinary.”</p>

    <p>The rediscovery of these paragraphs instigated a deep dismay because they still describe me so well. A sobering disappointment by realizing having learnt nothing. “As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span> Had I discerned those fickle emotions as meaningless limerence the relationship would've had a way higher success rate. Moron.</p>

    <h2>Initial infatuation as a requirement.</h2>
    <p>It seemed logical and natural to assume that initial infatuation was our body's way of pointing out compatible mates. Hence a requirement for a relationship. Not so. About two months after parting ways with Leia I had a deep conversation with someone I had known and talked to for while, but felt nothing special for. Not physically, not mentally. Yet after one or two talks there was an unexpected spark. Long story short, the whole thing turned out to be a dud, but then and there it dawned on me that hanging out with someone until infatuation grows organically <em>is</em> possible. My experiment worked, with the wrong person.</p>

    <p>I was lost and running in circles. Not practising philosophy was one thing, having a warped idea about love was another. Case in point the outstanding prescience of the aforementioned book: “a life characterised by a series of short-term infatuations.” What a punch in the gut that was. A painful motivator to look for answers. Which led a colleague to share Alain de Botton's talk “Why Romantics are Ruining Love.” It upended my dogmatic confidence in initial infatuation. My foundation for relationships were built on quicksand. </p>

    <p class="quote" title="“The way we love is very dependent on our societies, and nowadays we love romantically. We are all the heirs of romanticism. Romanticism is a very particular ideology and its worth just running through some of its most dominant features. Romanticism tells us that all of us have a soulmate out there, and it's our task to identify the soulmate. When we meet the soulmate we will feel a very special feeling, and a kind of instinctive attraction to this person and we will know they are our destiny. It might be in a bar, in a nightclub, in a train. We will have that special feeling. And then we'll call up our friends, “I've had that special feeling at last.” “That's terrific.” So everyone around us will have that special feeling and then they'll get married, have children, and if you don't have the special feeling you get very worried; you go on Tinder, Match.com, you're always ready for special feelings to come along, until the soulmate comes along. The good thing about finding a soul mate, when we eventually find the soulmate, we'll never be lonely again. All of us, everything that we are will be perfectly understood by another human being. It will mean the definitive end of any sense of alienation or loneliness. All our feeling or hopes will be confirmed by another person. So it's really terrific news. When the soulmate comes along we will have no more secrets. They will understand us totally and we will understand them. […]”">“The way we love is very dependent on our societies, and nowadays we love romantically. […] Romanticism tells us that all of us have a soulmate out there, and it's our task to identify the soulmate. When we meet the soulmate we will feel a very special feeling, and a kind of instinctive attraction to this person and we will know they are our destiny. […]”</p>

    <p>Guilty. Although I do not believe in “the one” but instead a set of “the ones”, overly relying on infatuation as a compass has caused avoidable hardships.</p>

    <!-- <p class="quote" title="“The other thing that romantics very much believe in is that love and sex go together. So previously people obviously had sex and had been in love, they didn't necessary always see them as entirely conjoined. Romantics believe that sex is the ultimate expression of love, which is why in the 19th century adultery becomes a tragedy, and becomes the most important theme of 19th century novels. All the great novels of the 19th century are in one way or another about adultery. Starting with Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina, and on and on. The reason why suddenly adultery is a disaster is because the romantics have made sex into a proof, the ultimate proof of love.”">“[…] The reason why suddenly adultery is a disaster is because the romantics have made sex into a proof, the ultimate proof of love.”</p> -->

    <p class="quote" title="“As you'll have gathered from my tone, I'm not an unalloyed fan of Romanticism. I believe it has caused us immense trouble. In fact I believe that Romanticism is the single greatest enemy we face for love. And that if we are to learn how to love better in the future, we must give up a lot of the feelings that got us into the sort of relationships that Romanticism points us towards.”">“[…] In fact I believe that Romanticism is the single greatest enemy we face for love. […] Now what is so wrong with Romanticism? Why the cynicism? Well let's start with a few points. One of the first things that's troublesome is that unlike what Romanticism tells us, we are not pure kind loving beings simply on the lookout for a soulmate. We are deeply dangerous, and most of us are on the edge of insanity. This is not an exception. It's just what it means to be human. All of us are only just holding it together. We are dangerous to be around. We have all sorts of impulses, feelings, desires, which make us great trouble to be around. The only people we can think of as normal are people we've just met. Once we've met them a little bit more we will soon realise that they are not normal.”</p>

    <p class="quote" title="“This is compounded by the fact that anyone we are likely to get together with is also going to be crazy. And they won't be able to tell us how they're crazy. Their craziness will be an intimate part of their own biography which we won't be able to get to by the normal kind of questions that we get addressed at a dinner date. One of the first questions we should be asking ourselves in a more psychologically aware society, one of the first questions you should ask anyone at a dinner date is “How are you mad?” “I am mad like this, how are you mad?” That should be a very standard question we ask each other over dinner but it's seen as an insulting question, it isn't.”">“[…] One of the first questions we should be asking ourselves in a more psychologically aware society, one of the first questions you should ask anyone at a dinner date is “How are you mad?” “I am mad like this, how are you mad?” That should be a very standard question we ask each other over dinner but it's seen as an insulting question, it isn't.”</p>

    <p>So, how are you mad?</p>

    <p>I for one have been mad about women. Not a “Fuck boy”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>, but I'm sure my occasional immaturity especially at younger ages hasn't helped prove the contrary. Experience tells me there are equally many promiscuous men and women. There's only one rule to follow: communicate expectations. When you don't you're screwing someone, when you do you're having sex. Whether promiscuous sex is fulfilling is another thing, which leads me to non-monogamy.</p>

    <h2>Monogamy versus non-monogamy.</h2>
    <p>Being on the fence about non-monogamy has influenced my capacity for commitment. Moreover, I dislike traditions, doing things because they're expected to. Yuck. And it's not only me, for non-traditional relationship are on the rise in Belgium&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>. But why be on the fence then? Some pros and cons.</p>

    <p>+ The utilitarian argument. The love of many increases the total amount of happiness in the world. Excluding debauchery, how does loving multiple people deteriorate society?</p>

    <p class="quote">“Love of one is a piece of barbarism: for it is practised at the expense of all others. Love of God likewise.” —Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil</p>

    <p>Jealousy? Sure, but I think that's because we're scared of losing someone, a remnant of a monogamous environment where others are competitors in a zero-sum game&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>: for someone to win, another must lose. Whereas within polyamory others are allies, a non-zero-sum game: for someone to win, another needn't lose.</p>

    <p>+ The imperfection argument. Finding partner Ω (omega) with characteristics {a, b, c, d, e} is unlikely. Why not partner up with person X for reasons {a, b, c} and person Y for reasons {c, d, e}? E.g., imagine loving someone but their antipathy for math leaves a void. You meet another algebra aficionado and fall for each other. Instead of subtracting, just add. Two partners. Feels weird right? But why should it. There are so many holistically beautiful people out there who deserve to be loved but aren't because we imagine a nuclear family as a law of nature. I do admit it is easier said than done. It ignores all the difficulties such as dividing attention and multiplying and raising the products.</p>

    <p class="quote">“People were created to be loved. Things were created to be used. The reason why the world is in chaos is because things are being loved and people are being used.” —Unknown&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></p>

    <!-- <p>+ People are not possessions. “She is <em>my</em> wife.” “He is <em>my</em> husband.” The “my” irks me.</p> -->

    <!-- <p>However, it's a weak subjective argument that stems from my aforementioned spurious interpretation of dependence. In a good relationship partners don't consider each other as property of course.</p> -->

    <p>+ The sex is just sex argument. Or as Marcus Aurelius tempered his urges by mindfully describing sexual intercourse as “the friction of a piece of gut and, following a sort of convulsion, the expulsion of some mucus.”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span> It's funny because it's true. Let's compound it with Alain de Botton's further observation that “The reason why suddenly adultery is a disaster is because the romantics have made sex into a proof, the ultimate proof of love.”</p>

    <p>Many relationships die because of adultery. Not because of the friction of a piece of gut, but because of the breach of trust. I think if we started seeing sex for what it is, clearly communicate, indulge when it disproportionally distracts us to regain focus, and realise that expulsion of some mucus does not equate extinction of love, break up rates would decline. It's just sex folks, let's not take ourselves too seriously, we've been doing it since we were fish. Blub. 🫧</p>

    <img src="media/fish-copulation.png" alt="Flinders University HD animation showing the earliest known copulation.">
    <p class="media-source">—Image: Flinders University HD animation showing the earliest known copulation&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>.</p>
    
    <p>- The consumerist argument: when one partner isn't enough, how many are? What prevents us from wanting more and more? “A time constraint.” True, but then what prevents us from acting the same as in serial-monogamy, swapping one partner with another when we find someone “better”. Does non-monogamy teach us that “better” is not, but merely newer? Why would an untrained mind's incapacity to deal with novel shiny things act differently under non-monogamy versus monogamy?</p>

    <p>≈ Either way, our Western society could sorely use more emphasis on being happy with what we've got. A middle ground might be to not actively seek for multiple partners, but when haphazardly bumping into a second “soulmate” I think it'd be a shame to destroy instead of nurture. As long as there's clear communication about the feasibility of expectations. Moreover, realistically, considering how extremely rare it is to encounter someone you connect with so profoundly, choice paralysis shouldn't be a problem. “Shouldn't”, because what do I know, I don't even have children yet. I'm probably way too vanilla to pull it off anyway.</p>

    <h2>Sexual distraction.</h2>
    <p>To be honest, it's not far-fetched to reason that the majority of people who think they are non-monogamous do so out of lust. We are evermore inundated with sexual imagery. It's all around us, constantly. Advertisements, television, social media, porn. When horny all the time it's easy to convince oneself of being a libertine. Right until orgasm, i.e., post-nut clarity&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>. Unless it's with a partner, or a <em>really</em> good girl friend, then I too realise the banality of it, and rather quickly feel drawn to my books again. Whereas I have met people who actually belong to that group. </p>

    <p>Not too long ago, a discussion about relationships and sex in a historical context led me to fill out a BDSM questionnaire. The highest score was 77% vanilla, the lowest 0% masochist, which corroborated my suspicion that I more want to be something than actually am something.</p>
