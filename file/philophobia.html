    <h1>Philophobia, the fear of love.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Tragedy is facing genuine love and not recognizing it. Or recognizing it, and unconsciously suppressing reciprocity. Love is all you need, they say. Not quite. When the reproductive organs do the “thinking” all one needs is lovers. Like heroin or money, it is prone to addiction and very distracting.</p>

    <hr class="hr-long">

    <h2>Prelude.</h2>
    <p>If I come across as a bad person, that's because I was. Sorry. Don't waste your energy hating me for I'm providing my own abundance of mental flagellation.</p>

    <p>When I first set foot in Brussels last year, my great relocation, I told myself not to have a relationship for twelve months and speedrun through experiences I should've had in my twenties. Being a bachelor, having my own place, alone… you catch my drift. Meanwhile though, I was still under the impression that a requirement for a good relationship is immediate infatuation, that certain kind of attraction that lingers throughout the day. Turns out I was wrong. I was under the impression that I was prone to certain physical traits. Turn out I was wrong. All in all regarding relationships, I was under the impression that I was right. I was wrong. A layman would mistake me for a wise man by quoting Socrates: “He knows that he knows nothing.” Socrates, however, would quote his contemporary layman: “What an idiot.”</p>

    <p>Around a month after arrival I met a certain Star Wars fan, but it needed very little force to fall into her gravitational pull. There was no pretending. The laughter was organic and plenty. She guided me out of my comfort zone, and I obliged, for a while. Given my inexperience and her steadfastness, the force encountered another, friction. Certain feeling weren't reciprocal so we stopped talking. Didn't work. We were still in orbiting each other. Eventually I was strong-armed into an ultimatum: relationship or indefinite silence. Goodbye twelve-month plan. Ideally I wanted to remain friends and let something grow on my side organically. I had not experienced that before, but considering she continuously wandered my mind, it was worth trying.</p>

    <p>Alas. Despite us feeling like we've been together for years, it did not work out. Our different running pace caused stress on either her or my side. Already ruminating about buying a house somewhere, not even two or three months into a relationship, is a pro marathon runner level. Usain Bolt wouldn't be able to keep up either; having the potential does not mean possible if the legs aren't trained for it.</p>

    <h2>Claustrophobia.</h2>
    <p>Continuing the metaphor, I have a talent for running. Fast. Unfortunately it's a condition I cannot seem to contain to bipedal movement. I've run from love twice. Not because there were compatibility problems—on the contrary—but because of feeling uncomfortable, constricted. A sensation of remarkable uneasiness. Like claustrophobia, an intense urge to get out. Even a simple caress of the head could trigger it. I don't know why. I truly hate myself recalling this—I made a beautiful being cry.</p>

    <p>I don't even know where to go with this essay. “To a psychologist!” you say? You're probably right. Before last year I've never even considered it since I assumed all of the above means something isn't meant to be. Nonsense in hindsight. The tragedy is that sometimes it <em>is</em> meant to be, and leaving makes life less good for both in the long run. The converse being equally possible of course. Anyway, I've had a fair share of flings, and most of the time you both just feel there's no synergy. But once in a while the conversations are effortless. No masks, no holding back, you're in tune with each other. But then: Beastie Boys - <em>Sabotage</em>&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>.</p>

    <p>What follows is some of the possible causes, and the most important realizations I've had this year. Blind of all the baggage one carries, the mind plays tricks on you, which are easily but ignorantly interpreted as a valid instinct/intuition. Wow. What a pretentious way of euphemizing forgetfulness, ignorance, stupidity, and plain selfishness.</p>

    <h2>No practice.</h2>

    <p class="quote">“Diogenes was acting on a crucial idea in Epicurus, that in order to live wisely it isn't enough just to read a philosophical argument once or twice, we need constant reminders of it, or we'll forget. When we're encouraged to go shopping by bright lights and inviting displays, we're quickly liable to lose sight of our true desires. So we have to counteract the influence of advertising by creating advertisements which say what we really do need, and that's why Diogenes put up his wall [on which the philosophy of Epicurus was inscribed].” —Alain de Botton</p>

    <p>“Or we'll forget” is what I did. Not exercising the physical body quickly becomes obvious through fat and decreased performance. Not training one's mind is more insidious since we easily justify our thoughts. Not even that. Without mindfulness we drive on autopilot. That being the case, due to the excitement of a new life I completely unconsciously lived antithetical to the philosophies within Marcus Aurelius' Meditations and especially Robin Hard's book on Diogenes: don't be a slave to primal reactionary emotions and desires, for those feelings are not in our control. What is in one's control is the ability to scrutinize those desires and acknowledge them as animalistic, simple-minded.</p>

    <p class="quote">“You have reason?—Yes, I do.—Then why not put it to use? For if this performs its function, what more do you desire?” —Marcus Aurelius (121–180)</p>

    <p>Once a <a href="../file/greed.html">slave in pursuit of money</a> until Diogenes' Cynicism threw me a rope, I fell right back into that kind of unexamined pursuit of women by neglecting basic principles. I even forgot I read a book called <em>Living With Limerence</em> about this pea brained behavior. Limerence is “the state of being obsessively infatuated with someone, usually accompanied by delusions of or a desire for an intense romantic relationship with that person”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>.</p>

    <p class="quote">“[…] We are most vulnerable to limerence when we do not understand ourselves, do not understand our drives, and react unthinkingly to the presence of an LO [limerent object] – led by our emotional impulses and enslaved to subconscious urges.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“[…] If you associate limerence with what love is, you will have a life characterised by a series of short-term infatuations. That’s fine, if that’s what you want, but if you are seeking a long-lasting bond of deep love, you need to accept that limerence will only be part of it during the early stages. And, as we’ve already covered in earlier chapters, it’s quite likely that you will succumb to limerence again if you are careless about managing the risks when you are in a long-term relationship.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“The goal, then, is not to stop being a limerent – I fundamentally don’t think that is possible – the goal is to integrate limerence into your life in a healthy way. To accept it as an aspect of yourself, but to develop the self-awareness and resilience needed to regulate it when it’s unwanted.”</p>

    <p class="quote">“They are not that special. Nobody is. You’ve probably had moments of clarity when you’ve seen this, and had that weird dissociative experience of wondering why you are so gaga about someone who is objectively pretty ordinary.”</p>

    <p>As I am writing this, rereading my summary of the book, I feel deeply taken aback due to having repeated the same mistake. A cutting disappointment. “As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span> If I had discerned those fickle emotions as meaningless limerence the relationship would've had a way higher success rate.</p>

    <h2>Initial infatuation.</h2>

    <h2>Polyamory versus monogamy.</h2>
    <p>I've never settled on whether monogamy makes sense or not. On one hand...</p>

    <h2>“It doesn't make sense!”</h2>

    <h2>An affectionate punch.</h2>

    <h2>Proud to talk about her even after the breakup.</h2>

    <h2>What is love?</h2>
