    <h1>Cleaning is tough.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Household cleaning is the toughest job I've ever done. It should not exist.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Preamble.</h2>
    <p>During times when I forget free will is an illusion and we are stardust floating trough space I often regret my poor life decisions. However, the advantage of having had a myriad of disparate jobs is that it widens one's perspective and increases empathy.</p>

    <p>Because <a href="./play.html">we work too much and play too little</a> I sought only for part-time jobs. What turned out to be a way trickier search than expected I finally landed a household cleaning function for the <abbr title="Openbaar centrum voor maatschappelijk welzijn">OCMW</abbr>, the Public Centre for Social Welfare. It was the middle of winter. The news seemed like a heart-warming present. It wasn't. To those who played <cite>Max Payne</cite>, promptly imagine a blizzard reverberating its soundtrack:</p>

    <h2>Toughest job.</h2>
    <p>Day one began motivated. Together with an enthusiastic supervisor we visited every location. Soon I was left to my own devices and began exploring the premises. ‚ÄúOkay let's do this.‚Äù I filled a bucket of water. Mopped a floor. Clean as a whistle. ‚ÄúNice!‚Äù Filled another bucket. Mopped a floor and wiped a toilet. Clean as a stinky whistle. ‚ÄúOkay, good!‚Äù Filled yet another bucket. Mopped a floor. Clean as a‚Ä¶ picks up an oozing ball of hair from a shower drain‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFuck!? How the hell did I end up here? What am I doing? What is happening?‚Äù For every floor I mopped, I mopped my brain with these thoughts tenfold. Stoicism works well to embrace events out of one's control, but dealing with wasted potential and declining creativity is another beast.</p>

    <p>Day two. One hour before the alarm rang I consciously tried to enjoy every bit of warmth before having trudge the snow again. Fast forward, at the end of the week I quit. The endless monotony gives one's mind free range to spiral. But the decisive factor was physical health. Even at part-time capacity of daily four hours my knees were hurting after three days. Not to sound pretentious, but as a skateboarder getting physically hurt by impact is common and expected, so I know pain and I think I handle it well. Therefore I can objectively compare the two and conclude that the kind of pain by repetitive strain during cleaning is something wholly different and doesn't strengthen the body. This meant a resounding ‚ÄúNope!‚Äù because it prevented doing sports, something which has always been a crucial method of dealing with and finding a way out of adversity.</p>

    <p>I was lucky. I could get out because for better or worse I had my <a href="./moveout.html">parents as a safety net</a>. Many, probably most people do not. There's a mortgage to pay and family to tend do. They have to rinse, they have to repeat. The majority of friends' family members who clean as a profession have physical health problems. Those that I know do too, and one of them wakes up at 4AM to take the train at 5AM, no fancy telework possible. No wonder being on the dole is often preferable. One friend's mother straight up quit without any possibility of severance. It's that bad.</p>

    <h2>Redundant.</h2>
    <p>Why do we go on like this? Can't we just live smaller and work less in order to clean up our own mess? Not only at home, but even at companies I'd envision the same. We sit down too much&nbsp;<span class="source">[<a href="#sources">‚á£</a>]</span>, and/or grow too fat anyway. I won't even include sources on cardiovascular disease, just look at the gluttony caused obesity around you.</p>

    <p>Sorry, I lied. So how about we spend perhaps a meagre thirty minutes each day to clean up after ourselves so we all live healthier?</p>

    <h2>‚ÄúThey took our jobs!‚Äù</h2>

    <p>Don't get me wrong, I do not wish to rob people of their livelihood. I'm arguing that by making cleaning redundant, we can provide more vacancies in cognitively stimulating fields. Those who say that some people are too stupid for X or Y lack vision and wisdom.</p>
