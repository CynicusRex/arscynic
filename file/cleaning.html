    <h1>Cleaning is tough.</h1>
    <p class="sub-title">Household cleaning is the toughest job <em>I</em> have ever done. It should not exist.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Preamble.</h2>
    <p>During times when I forget free will is an illusion and we are stardust floating trough space I often regret my poor life decisions. However, the advantage of an eclectic history is that it widens one's perspective and increases empathy.</p>

    <p>Because <a href="./play.html">we work too much and play too little</a> I sought only for part-time jobs. After what turned out to be a trickier search than expected I eventually landed a household cleaning function for the <abbr title="Centrum Algemeen Welzijn">CAW</abbr>, a Belgian General Welfare Centre. It was the middle of winter. The news seemed like a heart-warming present. It wasn't. To those who played <cite>Max Payne</cite>, promptly imagine a blizzard breeze reverberating its soundtrack. To those who didn't, imagine roaming the snowy New York streets captured below while having hit rock-bottom.</p>

    <h2>Toughest job.</h2>
    <p>Day one began motivated. While facing the deteriorating weather by bike an enthusiastic supervisor accompanied me to every location. Sooner than expected I was left to my own devices and began exploring the premises. ‚ÄúOkay let's do this. At least I'm warm and inside.‚Äù I filled a bucket of water. Mopped a floor. Clean as a whistle. ‚ÄúNice!‚Äù Filled another bucket. Mopped a floor and wiped a toilet. Clean as a stinky whistle. ‚ÄúOkay, good!‚Äù Filled yet another bucket. Mopped a floor. Clean as a‚Ä¶ picks up an oozing ball of hair from a shower drain‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFuck!? How the hell did I end up here? What am I doing? What is happening?‚Äù For every floor I mopped, I mopped my brain with these thoughts tenfold. Stoicism works well to embrace events out of one's control, but dealing with aimless wasted potential and loss of hope was out of my league.</p>

    <p>Day two. One hour before the alarm rang I consciously tried to enjoy every bit of warmth before having trudge the snow again. Fast forward, at the end of the week I quit. The endless monotony gives one's mind free range to spiral. But the decisive factor was physical health. Even at part-time capacity of daily four hours my knees were hurting after three days. That says a lot considering I am used to pain from skateboarding where getting physically hurt by impact is routine. Either you hit the floor, or the board hits you. Therefore, allow me to compare the two and conclude that the kind of pain by repetitive strain during cleaning hits like an injury. It doesn't make me feel alive, it doesn't strengthen the body. Moreover, unlike skateboarding, one cannot simply stop working to recover as one sees fit. This meant a resounding ‚ÄúNope!‚Äù Sports has always been a crucial method of dealing with and finding a way out of adversity. Without it I wither.</p>

    <p>But I was lucky. I could get out because for better or worse I had my <a href="./moveout.html">parents as a safety net</a>. Many, probably most people do not. There's a mortgage to pay and family to tend do. They <em>have</em> to rinse, they <em>have</em> to repeat. The majority of my acquaintances' family members who clean as a profession have physical health problems. Those that I know do too, and one of them wakes up at 4AM to take the train at 5AM, no fancy working from home. It doesn't take a genius to realise why being on the dole is often preferable. One friend's mother straight up quit without any possibility of severance. It's that bad.</p>

    <h2>Redundant.</h2>
    <p>Why do we go on like this? Can't we just live smaller and work less in order to clean up our own mess? Not only at home, but even at work I'd envision the same. For one, we sit down too much&nbsp;<span class="source">[<a href="#sources">‚á£</a>]</span>, and/or two, we are too fat, just look at the gluttony around you. I won't even include sources on cardiovascular diseases.</p>

    <p>Sorry, I lied.</p>

    <p>Three, recent research showed that about 35% of Canadian employees are bored at work, the ‚Äúboredom boreout syndrome‚Äù&nbsp;<span class="source">[<a href="#sources">‚á£</a>]</span>. While Canada doesn't represent all relevant countries, I bet it's not too far off. So how about a change of pace by spending perhaps a meagre thirty minutes each day to clean up after ourselves so we all live healthier?</p>

    <h2>‚ÄúThey took our jobs!‚Äù</h2>

    <p>Before being burned at the stake for ideas that might seem preposterous to some, I do not wish to rob people of their livelihood. I simply argue that by making the household/office cleaning profession redundant by doing it ourselves we can provide more vacancies in cognitively stimulating fields. To those who claim that there will always be a large portion of people too stupid for more intellectually demanding jobs:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>‚ÄúC'est celui qui dit qui l'est.‚Äù</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Come now, ye of little faith. Two hundred years ago they thought only a select set of humans were capable of reading and writing, which is now obviously false, we now know nearly everyone can&nbsp;<span class="source">[<a href="#sources">‚á£</a>]</span>. Two hundred years ago they thought slavery was necessary to get things done, which is also obviously false, but unfortunately still present by outsourced labour. The same ‚Äúoopsies‚Äù hold true for female suffrage, smoking, apartheid, et cetera. Within one hundred years we will look back with equal disgust on carnism, bullshit jobs, and another plethora of et cetera.</p>
