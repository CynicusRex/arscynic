    <h2>Glossary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>FPV: first person view. Generally referring to any drone / quadcopter / unmanned aerial vehicle (<abbr title="unmanned aerial vehicle">UAV</abbr>) equipped with a camera that transmits video signals to a goggle where the camera acts as a “stand-in” for a pilot. I.e., it's as if the pilot is physically present in the drone.</li>
      <li>RTF: ready-to-fly. Generally referring to drone kits that have everything included to start flying FPV, except for brains.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>“I am impatient and I want to start now!”</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Buy the <a href="https://www.radiomasterrc.com/collections/boxer-radio">RadioMaster <cite>Boxer</cite></a> radio controller (± $140); <abbr title="ExpressLRS; express long range system">ELRS</abbr> + <abbr title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</abbr> *,</li>
      <li>buy the controller's <a href="https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/2s-7-4v-6200mah-lipo-battery">battery</a>&nbsp;<span class="dagger">†</span> (± $30),</li>
      <li>download ORQA's free <a href="https://skydive.orqafpv.com"><cite>FPV.SkyDive</cite></a> drone flying simulator.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>RadioMaster is a reputable brand with their <cite>T16S</cite> controller being an industry standard. However, for beginners it is overkill, and it is probably too big. The <cite>Boxer</cite> feels just right, tending towards “too big” too if I were obligated to choose.</p>

    <p>“But a simulator is boring and not real!”</p>
    <p>It is <em>not</em> boring. One <em>will</em> crash their drone in real life. One <em>doesn't</em> want to injure bystanders. Dependent on size, the blows can <span style="color: red;">bleed</span>, the blades can blind, and the massive can kill.</p>

    <p>Two, while already being able to practise in a simulator one can take their time to assemble the remaining parts of the FPV puzzle in case this guide is deviated from.</p>


    <p class="footnote">– – – – –</p>
    <p class="footnote">* Version ELRS, ExpressLRS, or Express Long Range System is an open source and future-proof radio control link.<br> Region FCC pertains the <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>'s Federal Communications Commission and has a more lenient limit on power output (read: range). One can easily flash the firmware to the European listen-before-talk (<abbr title="listen before talk">LBT</abbr>) protocol when necessary. Both work anywhere.</p>
    <p class="footnote">† The <cite>Boxer</cite> can charge its battery via USB-C. Therefore one doesn't need a separate charger yet.</p>


    <h2>Why not RTF?</h2>
    <p>Wasted money, wasted resources. Buying an RTF FPV kit is convenient but leads to wasted resources because many parts are useless once one continues and advances the hobby—which is likely. However, properly getting started with FPV is an overwhelming time-consuming endeavour due to the vast choice pool and myriad of components that need to be compatible. Within this guide that work is done for the reader such that in addition to resources less time is wasted too, without an overly large loss of knowledge.</p>

    <h2>Why buy expensive gear as a novice?</h2>
    <p> When one buys proper gear it is a smart investment no matter if one continues the hobby or not—any hobby. Let's consider a cheap versus an expensive controller; assuming those adjectives are respectively synonymous with crap and quality. In case one continues the hobby the expensive controller will serve the pilot throughout its lifetime whereas the cheap controller will quickly be discarded. Subsequently, it is unlikely the cheap gear will ever find a second-hand buyer, contrary to the expensive controller in case one doesn't continue.</p>

    <p>More importantly, not buying crappy toys sends a signal to the market to make less of them. Screw null-brained consumerism.</p>

    <h2>Which components?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>FPV flying simulator</li>
      <li>Radio controller (+ battery)</li>
      <li>Quadcopter (+ batteries + antenna)</li>
      <li>Goggles (+ battery + antennas + microSD card)</li>
      <li>Charger (+ adapter)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1. FPV flying simulator</h3>
    <p>Similar to “think before you speak”, “practise before you fly”. Learning how to pilot a drone beforehand avoids damage to others, yourself, and one's wallet.</p>

    <p>ORQA's free <a href="https://skydive.orqafpv.com"><cite>FPV.SkyDive</cite></a> is the simulator I use. It works. It's enjoyable. But, it did introduce some ingame controls and audio bugs on the latest update. There are free/paid perhaps superior alternatives but I haven't tested them yet.</p>

    <h4>Angle vs. horizon vs. acro mode</h4>
    <p>My own experience tells me most people assume drones are easy to fly and balance themselves automatically, but there are in fact three modes of which only “acro mode” is worth flying; acro for acrobatics.</p>

    <p>Angle and horizon mode automatically level the drone, with the latter mode also supporting automatic flips. Drone <em>toys</em> tend to have these modes by default, giving the wrong impression to people who buy them on a whim and end up with undeserved cockiness. Being 100% proficient in flying with self-levelling modes still means 0% proficiency in acro mode. Being able to <em>ride</em> a <cite>Grumman F-14 Tomcat</cite> fighter jet around the tarmac doesn't make one capable of flying it.</p>

    <p>Therefore, launch your simulator and master acro.</p>

    <h3>2. Radio controller</h3>
    <p>A decent radio controller can be modified to steer any drone and can therefore last an entire career. If there was only one kit component one couldn't cheap out on, then the radio controller would be it.</p>

    <p>The RadioMaster <cite>Boxer</cite> belongs to that category. Its specifications are beyond the scope of this essay, but my selling points were:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>RadioMaster stood the test of time,</li>
      <li>the website seems more professional than the competitors,</li>
      <li>their products being ubiquitous means faster learning/problem-solving.</li>
    </ul>
