    <h2>Requirements for consideration.</h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li>No advertising, trackers, etc., whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Free. All of the main features must be available for free.</li>
      <li>No already rich people/companies.</li>
      <li>No association with or reference to crypto“currencies” because these are <a href="./../file/cryptocultscience.html">greed incentivizing pyramid schemes</a>.</li>
      <li>That I'd be quite annoyed if said software didn't exist.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The donation amount.</h2>
    <p>The donation amount is in proportion to my usage and whether software is in constant development, e.g., an operating system (<abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr>)—not to be confused with malware that is <cite>Microsoft “Windoze”</cite>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“a shitty operating system created by a monopoly. Commonly used by idiots who are too stupid to <abbr title="read the fucking manual">RTFM</abbr>. The only feature that Windoze has that Linux doesn't is the <abbr title="blue screen of death">BSOD</abbr>, commonly seen by Windoze users.” —<cite>I hate winblows</cite>&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Arguably another feature of Windoze is that it instigated the Half Life saga…</p>

    <p>Jesting aside, before talking money I must share my bias that when I buy a product I prefer owning it. However, considering something that's constantly under development, one cannot expect to pay for it once and receive all subsequent non-security updates. Time has been invested by its developers and housing/food is not free. To exaggerate a bit, in our current economic system I don't think it's fair to pay for an OS once and expect access to the n-th upgrade of said OS many years later. So, in this case a monthly subscription makes sense. Conversely, for software that doesn't get updates, or doesn't need to get them, or where the updates don't matter that much to me, a one-time donation seems sufficient; back in the oblivious days where I still used Microsoft products I was fine using <cite>Office 2010</cite> indefinitely. Obviously now I just pirate that nonsense if I cannot circumvent it.</p>

    <p>Anyway, regarding subscriptions, the highest tier gets €3.50—“tree fiddy”&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>—a month, the middle tier €2.25, and the default tier €1. These respectively add up to a yearly €42, €27, and €12 donation. One-time donations are €5.</p>

    <ul>

        <p>To me <cite>uBlock Origin</cite> is one of the most indispensable pieces of code on the <cite>World Wide Web</cite>. How people can surf the Web without it is beyond me. What's equally baffling is that Raymond Hill <a title="I do not want the administrative workload that comes with donations. I do not want the project to become in need of funding in any way: no dedicated home page + no forum = no cost = no need for financial support. I want to be free to move on to something else if ever I get tired of working on these projects (no donations = no expectations).

    <h2>Feasibility of altruism.</h2>

    <p>The individual donations may seem trivial, but let's say a piece of software has 10000 users—0.0000012% of humanity—and they all pay €5, that's a decent sum. Unfortunately only a minority of people pay for free software&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>, rarely enough to live on. Even worse, the majority of humanity cannot cough up a yearly ±€350 for donations. But let me throw a curveball: ideally they shouldn't. People shouldn't be reliant on the whims of greedy white men such as myself who more often indulge a €4.5 portion of <i>French Fries</i> unnecessary for sustenance rather than investing it in something meaningful—not to be mistaken with something lucrative, because the profit motive is what's killing our habitat, us.</p>

    <p>Creative people who contribute for the sake of creativity, not for profit, should be able to do so without having to worry about food or housing. In fact, not only creative people, but everyone. After all, who is to decide what is useful? Similarly to why we can only discern happiness through the contrast with sadness, we need the “useless” to discern the useful. Nothing matters and everything matters. We're a collection of atoms meandering on a rock that's speeding through space, orbiting the Sun at 30 ㎞ per second, in a <span title="The Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune">solar system</span> that's orbiting the center of our galaxy at 200 ㎞ per second&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>. Tell me again how important you think you are?<span hidden> Fuck your pretentions.</span></p>

    <p>Hear me coming yet? Universal basic income, <abbr title="universal basic income">UBI</abbr>. What would a society look like where people who provide excellent products free of charge <em>despite</em> working a full-time job could pursue their side projects full-time instead? What would the world look like if the hundreds of thousands of children begging for money could instead be studying to become cobblers or cryobioligists? Considering the extent of our Western excesses we definitely have the means to level the playing field to such an extent. If we Westerners lived like we did one hundred years ago we'd still be better off than most of Earth's population.</p>

    <p>To quote Buckminster again and again* until it collectively seeped into our thick skulls:</p>

    <blockquote>
			<p>“We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.” —Buckminster Fuller <span class="quote-year">(1895–1983)</span>&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></p>

    <h2>“Shit-ass pet fuckers.”</h2>

    <p>Albeit hypocritical, I often imagine being rich. Not only do I want to support developers that refuse ads, I also desperately want to apply Louis C.K.'s “shit-ass pet fucker” method for skateparks. It's so goddamn frustrating that my local skatepark isn't able to own a permanent building and had to move four times already&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>. Sure, our economic system has lifted <em>us</em> out of poverty and into exorbitant wealth—by exploiting other countries, mind you—but there's something seriously flawed if a project with obvious societal benefits can't stand on its own feet.</p>

    <p>The <del>utopian</del> best-case scenario however, is that there wouldn't exist and wouldn't be a need for absurdly affluent people who can singularly decide who gets money, who gets to live or die. For one, power causes brain damage which renders rich people literally incapable of knowing what is best for others:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Subjects under the influence of power, he found in studies spanning two decades, acted as if they had suffered a traumatic brain injury—becoming more impulsive, less risk-aware, and, crucially, less adept at seeing things from other people’s point of view.”</p>

      <p>“And when he put the heads of the powerful and the not-so-powerful under a transcranial-magnetic-stimulation machine, he found that power, in fact, impairs a specific neural process, “mirroring,” that may be a cornerstone of empathy.” —<cite>Power Causes Brain Damage</cite>, by Jerry Useem for The Atlantic&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Furthermore, their supposed philanthropy isn't just them giving money away no-questions-asked. More often than not they aim to benefit their coffers or virtue signal their “conscience”:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“They are moving away from unfettered, no-strings-attached giving and toward increased donor control over organizations, and are blurring the lines between private investment and public benefit.” —<cite>Gilded Giving 2020</cite>, by Chuck Collins and Helen Flannery&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Your "Giving Pledge" has a loophole that renders it practically worthless, namely permitting pledgees to simply name charities in their wills. I have found that most billionaires or near billionaires hate giving large sums of money away while alive and instead set up family-controlled foundations to do it for them after death. And these foundations become, more often than not, bureaucracy-ridden sluggards. These rich are delighted to toss off a few million a year in order to remain socially acceptable. But that's it.” —Robert Wilson to Bill Gates, 2010&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Be that as it may, the simplest argument against the ultra rich is that it's downright unethical. As long as there are people without a home, the ability to own more than one, for-profit, should be unlawful. The reason why there's a housing crises is not migrant—a scapegoat they would like you to believe—but, again, the rich. These gluttonous pretentious buffoons are buying up everything&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>. The game is rigged folks.</p>

    <h2>Good governance and taxes.</h2>
    <p>Before we bring out the pitchforks, let's address non-violent solutions: good governance and taxes. While listening to the <cite>Very Bad Wizards</cite> podcast this week I heard them pondering why capitalism as well as communist Russia fails at preventing crime. Well the common denominator is obvious no? Humans.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“This is my first time at Davos, and I find it quite a bewildering experience to be honest. I mean fifteen hundred private jets have flown in here to hear Sir David Attenborough speak about how we're wrecking the planet. And I hear people talking the language of participation and justice and equality and transparency, but almost no one raises the real issue of tax avoidance; of the rich just not paying their fair share. I mean it feels like I'm at a fire fighter's conference and no one is allowed to speak about water. There was only one panel hidden away in the media center that was actually about tax avoidance, I was one of the fifteen participants, something needs to change here. Ten years ago, the World Economic Forum asked the question: "What must industry do to prevent a broad social backlash?" The answer is very simple, just stop talking about philanthropy and start talking about taxes. Taxes taxes. Just two days ago there was a billionaire in here, Michael Dell, and he asked the question: "Name me one country where a top marginal tax rate of 70% has actually worked", and you know I'm the historian, The United States, that's where it has actually worked. In the 1950s during the republican president Eisenhower, the war veteran. The top marginal tax rate in the US was 91% for people like Michael Dell. The top estate tax for people like Michael Dell was 70%. I mean, this is not rocket science. We can talk for a very long time about these stupid philanthropy schemes, we can invite Bono once more, but come one, we got to be talking about taxes. That's it, taxes taxes taxes. All the rest is bullshit, in my opinion.” —Rutger Bregman, Davos 2019&nbsp;<span class="source">[]</span>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    

    <p>The solution is simple: tax</p>
